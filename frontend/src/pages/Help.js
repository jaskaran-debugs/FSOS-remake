  ["Create a BO idea", "In BO Studio → New BO idea. Add a source, slides, visual-hook notes, choose several IPs and distinct page hooks. Creator & timestamp are captured automatically. Anchor a comment to a slide in the Brief tab."],
  ["Approve & assign", "As Founder, open the idea and Approve. As COA, in Production & Review assign one designer to the whole idea, set a deadline and reviewer. All versions keep the same owner."],
  ["Produce & review", "Add Canva/Drive links inside each version. Submit for review, approve some versions and request changes on one. Partial readiness shows consistently in Production, Bank and the card."],
  ["Replace an asset", "Replace one approved asset — only that version returns to review; unrelated versions and published history stay intact."],
  ["Bulk placement", "As COC, Distribution → Bulk placement. Select a batch, define a multi-day rotation, preview conflicts and counts, adjust, confirm. Inspect in Calendar, Matrix and Today."],
  ["Conflicts & collaboration", "Try placing the same idea on two IPs the same day — you'll get a repetition conflict needing an authorised exception. Collaborations are one publication linked to multiple IPs, counted once in network totals."],
  ["HPN fast flow", "HPN Desk → create, use the authorised pre-approval bypass, then Quick record to log owner/assets/review outcome in one step. Publish and confirm. TAT basis is shown."],
  ["Displace BO with HPN", "When HPN takes a BO slot, the displaced BO version is rescheduled or returned to the unallocated bank — never lost; age & approval preserved."],
  ["Confirm publication", "Today / a card → Confirm publication with URL and actual time. A 24h capture task is created. A collaboration adds only one publication's views to network totals."],
  ["Capture views", "Performance → Capture. Enter views (including an explicit zero, a late measurement, or leave missing). Classifications, age labels, yesterday's cohort and six-day cycles update."],
  ["Floors & reserves", "Command Room & Today show that surplus Reels never cover a Posts shortfall, optional upper ranges aren't failures, and unconfigured BO quotas show 'Not configured' — no fake coverage."],
  ["Add a 9th IP / new editor", "Settings → Add IP appears everywhere instantly with no invented history. Add an editor, assign an idea, verify My Work."],
  ["Pause / deactivate", "Pause an IP or deactivate a teammate — historical work stays intact; future/unfinished work surfaces for reassignment."],
  ["Refresh persists", "Refresh the browser — every edit, assignment, comment, approval, placement, publication and metric persists (local storage). Reset demo from the clock chip bottom-right."],
